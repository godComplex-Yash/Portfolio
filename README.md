Nothing just a portfolio website, I built for me, inspired by a YouTube tutorial, Not cause I fucking can't create one of my own, but just because I loved the idea...
I am not a frontend developer bro and I dont fuck with LLMs and GenAI systems to generate code for me instead I would watch a youtube tutorial for something that I dont know and will prefer a codealong session anyday...
